# Udemy Progress Reset and Completer

A chrome extension to reset and complete your courses on Udemy.

I wanted to reset my courses on Udemy to start over and complete them. I couldn't find any extension to do that so I made one.

## How to reset a course

1. Go to an Udemy course where you have already made some progress.

2. Make sure the **Course Content** panel is open

3. On the extension popup, select the Reset Progress button.

4. The panels will expand and then close, with your progress remaining at 0; this is user feedback to let you know it's working!

5. Enjoy the new beginning!
